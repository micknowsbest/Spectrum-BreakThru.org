Helping Individuals gain their independence

If you think we could be a good fit for you,in terms of our services please apply!

We are trying to remain flexible to everyone's demands, as some may need something as simple as their routine being printed out once a day or multiple times threw out the day, and some need more complex systems that manage business decisions for them for their small business running out of their home.

Day Program
When the pandemic was really going I noticed alot of our guys were doing to these virtual day programs and I was able to see what was missing, and I am aiming to add to what they achieved by adding tools that they were missing to provide a more one on one experience.

Projects
if you like to see more details on any of our projects click above

This is where we are going to have more info on projects
Project Routine Management
This software is made to automatically print off the forms that get filled out. Additionally, you can have it print out paper tokens for their token economy

Currently, we provide the routine management system for free!
Project Good Behavior Soda Delivery
The idea of this is you provide the individual long term gratification to solving short term problems.

The Terms that we have found that work are every 3 days delivery of soda and or granola bar and sometimes pop tarts.
Project Mini Plan
The idea of this project is to put equipment in the hands of creative individuals in hopes they can create works of art for themselves and once they get a collection and run out of space they can sell it online to someone who appreciates it just as much as them.

The Mini Plan would offer:

Mini 3D Printer
Mini Computer With Monitor and Keyboard/Mouse
Thermal Printer
Paired That with the free routine software, and you have a cool combo
This plan would be a good starting point to then be able to expand from later.

We are currently getting setup for a at home Day Program / Job Coaching and that is how our program is and going to be structured but we may add additional filings if we are able
We are trying to break down our core functions and expand from there
Notice We Turn Some Servers off if not in use to save resources until we expand so please message us for any help in our services thanks
Edit
Routine Management System
This system is basically a list of forms that can be filled out and submitted, and printed daily and amended to a summary for monthly or quarterly inspection, and easily graph it for comparison to see if any success is being made overall or in certain areas.

We use google services for this but are working on moving to another more easier to manage system called process maker We give this software service to all of our individuals for free

We have :Daily Routine, Calorie Count, Delayed Access Training. Problem-Solving Training, relaxation training, behavior tracking, token economy and much more..
