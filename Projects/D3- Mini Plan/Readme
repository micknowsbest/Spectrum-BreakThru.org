The idea of this project is to put equipment in the hands of creative individuals in hopes they can create works of art for themselves and once they get a collection and run out of space they can sell it online to someone who appreciates it just as much as them while they build up valuable works skills.

The Mini Plan would offer:

Mini 3D Printer
Mini Computer With Monitor and Keyboard/Mouse
Thermal Printer
Paired That with the free routine software, and you have a cool combo
This plan would be a good starting point to then be able to expand from later.
