We understand that sometimes the little computers we provide aren't powerful enough to run some programs. 
That said, we enable you to be able to Remote Desktop into one of our powerful computers.

In order to use a controller, you will need to install something called a driver on your computer : 
https://github.com/microsoft/RdpGamepad
https://github.com/microsoft/RdpGamepad/releases/download/v1.0.2/RdpGamepadClientInstall-1.0.2.exe

To remote in, go to remote desktop on your computer. In the search box on the taskbar, type Remote Desktop Connection,
and then select Remote Desktop Connection

-Then you want to hit show more options : and go to local resources, then at the bottom you will see local devices and resources and click more.
-Check mark "others supported plug and play pnp devices" and " other supported remote fx usb devices" if you have that option available.
-Go back to general tab and in the computer field type: rdp.norccs.com  for computer 1 or rdp.norccs.com:3390 for computer 2
-Then you can click " Allow me to save credentials" if you're on your on personal computer. 

Then a window with the remote desktop should appear. Login with the credentials provided 


Thank You and let me know if you need any help .

TLDR:
 rdp.norccs.com  for computer 1 or rdp.norccs.com:3390 for computer 2
