We Understand that sometimes the little computers we provide arn't powerfull enough to run some programs. 
That said we enable you to be able to RemoteDesktop into one of our powerfull computers.

In order to use a controler you will need to install something called a driver on your computer : 
https://github.com/microsoft/RdpGamepad
https://github.com/microsoft/RdpGamepad/releases/download/v1.0.2/RdpGamepadClientInstall-1.0.2.exe

To remote in go to remote desktop on your computer. In the search box on the taskbar, type Remote Desktop Connection,
and then select Remote Desktop Connection

-Then you want to hit show more options : and go to local resources then at the bottem you will see local devices and resources and click more.
-Check mark "other supported plug and play pnp devices" and " other supported remote fx usb devices" if you have that option avaliable.
-Go back to general tab and in the computer field type: rdp.norccs.com  for computer 1 or rdp.norccs.com:3390 for computer 2
-Then you can click " Allow me to save credentials" if your on your personal computer. 

Then a window with the remote desktop should apear. Login with the credentials provided
